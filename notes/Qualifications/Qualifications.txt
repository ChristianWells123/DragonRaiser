Touched a lizard one time
Fed and maintained a dog for two years
Founded the lettuce club at my school
Ate a really spicy pepper one time and it felt like I was breating fire
Saw two horses do it once
Cousin has seen a dragon (in real life) (really)
Farmhand for my parents
Thinks Dragons are really cool
Has a baby sibling
Not afraid of bugs
[Crude drawing of a dragon] "I can draw dragons!!! See???"

(After a dragon has burned a village)
Village was visited by a dragon
Parents told me I can't, so that means I'd be great
